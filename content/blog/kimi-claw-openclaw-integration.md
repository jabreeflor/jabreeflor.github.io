# Kimi Claw: OpenClaw Goes Native in Your Browser

[Kimi.ai](https://kimi.com) just announced **Kimi Claw** — a native integration of OpenClaw that runs directly in your browser tab, online 24/7. This is significant: one of the major AI platforms is embedding the open-source agent framework as a first-class feature.

## What's Included

### 🔹 ClawHub Access

5,000+ community skills from the ClawHub library, available instantly. No setup, no installation — just discover and use.

The skill library includes everything from code generation to data analysis to automation workflows. The community has been building fast.

### 🔹 40GB Cloud Storage

Massive file storage built in. Your agent has persistent access to documents, data, and outputs across sessions.

This solves one of the friction points with local agents: you don't need to manage file syncing or worry about context limits for large documents.

### 🔹 Pro-Grade Search

Live data fetching from sources like Yahoo Finance. The agent can pull real-time market data, news, and structured information directly.

This is the difference between an agent that knows things and an agent that can *look things up* — a critical capability for anything involving current information.

### 🔹 Bring Your Own Claw

This is the interesting one. You can:

- **Connect third-party OpenClaw instances** to kimi.com
- **Chat with your existing setup** through their interface
- **Bridge to external apps** like Telegram groups

Essentially, Kimi becomes a frontend for any OpenClaw deployment. Your self-hosted agent, their UI.

## Why This Matters

### The Agent Platform War

We're watching AI platforms compete on agent capabilities:

- **Claude** has Claude Code and tool use
- **ChatGPT** has plugins and GPTs
- **Gemini** has extensions
- **Kimi** now has native OpenClaw

The pattern: every major platform is racing to become the hub where agents live and work.

### Open Source Wins Again

OpenClaw started as an open-source project. Now it's being integrated into commercial platforms as a feature. This is the dream outcome for open source: become so useful that platforms adopt you rather than build their own.

The 5,000+ skills in ClawHub? Community-built. The integrations? Community-designed. Kimi is essentially standing on the shoulders of open-source contributors.

### Interoperability

The "Bring Your Own Claw" feature hints at a future where agents are portable. Run your agent anywhere, connect it to any interface. Your setup, your rules, multiple frontends.

This is healthier than vendor lock-in. If you don't like Kimi's interface tomorrow, your agent and its configuration still work elsewhere.

## Getting Access

Currently in beta for "Allegretto members and above" (Kimi's paid tiers). Try it at [kimi.com/bot](https://kimi.com/bot).

## The Bigger Picture

We're moving from "AI chatbots" to "AI agents with persistent capabilities." The chatbot answers questions. The agent takes actions, remembers context, and integrates with your tools.

Kimi Claw is another signal that this shift is accelerating. The major platforms aren't just adding features — they're reimagining what an AI product looks like.

Expect more announcements like this from other platforms. The agent race is on.
