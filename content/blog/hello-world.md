# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! I've been meaning to start writing for a while now, and this is the first step.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about things I find interesting in software engineering — the tools I build, problems I run into, and ideas I'm exploring. Topics will range from:

- **Dev tools** — building desktop apps with Electron, VS Code extensions, and CLI tools
- **Web development** — React, Next.js, and the modern frontend stack
- **Side projects** — the process of building and shipping things
- **Technical deep dives** — how things work under the hood

## Why Write?

Writing helps me think more clearly about the work I do. It forces me to explain ideas in a way that actually makes sense, and it creates a record I can look back on.

If you find any of this useful, that's a bonus.

## What I'm Working On

Right now I'm focused on a few projects:

- **Internet Archaeology** — a tool for exploring web history through the Wayback Machine
- **NVM GUI** — making Node version management painless
- **Prism** — an MCP server for code intelligence

More to come. Stay tuned.
